# Grievance Management System

Below is a comprehensive summary of our project solution:

---

### Project Overview

Our team, *Bugs*, developed an AI-enhanced solution to address the challenges faced by the Integrated Grievance Redressal System (IGRS). The primary goal is to improve the Decision Support System (DSS) by enabling government officials to make data-driven decisions while managing and resolving citizen grievances more effectively.

### System Architecture and Workflow

1. *Dual Webpages:*  
   - *Citizen Portal:*  
     - **Submission:** Citizens can submit their grievances by providing details such as title, description, district, and phone number.
     - **Verification:** An OTP-based verification process ensures the authenticity of the submissions.
     - **Tracking:** Citizens have access to view all their submitted grievances, fostering transparency.
   
   - *Official/Admin Portal:*  
     - *Secure Access:* Officials log in and verify their identity using email verification.
     - *Dashboard:* The dashboard displays all grievances relevant to the officialâ€™s district. It dynamically updates to include both new and previously submitted grievances.
     - *Trending Analysis:* In addition to the standard grievance list, the admin dashboard now features a trending analysis panel. A visual chart displays which grievance category is trending in each district. When a trend is detected, the system automatically sends an email alert to the corresponding district official, ensuring they can promptly address emerging issues.
   
2. *Real-Time Updates:* 
   - Once a new grievance is submitted and verified, it appears immediately on the admin dashboard alongside earlier submissions, ensuring that the latest issues are promptly visible.

### AI Integration for Enhanced Decision Support

- *Tone and Urgency Analysis:* 
  The core innovation in our solution is the integration of an AI model capable of analyzing the tone of each grievance. This analysis determines the urgency of the issue, allowing the system to automatically sort and prioritize grievances.
  
- *Impact on Decision Making:*  
  By ranking grievances based on urgency, the DSS helps government officials quickly identify and focus on high-priority cases. This automated triage system aids in efficient resource allocation and faster resolution, thereby enhancing overall governance outcomes.
